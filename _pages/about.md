Hi, I am a Ph.D. student at KAIST advised under [Prof. Dongsu Han](http://ina.kaist.ac.kr/~dongsuh/)Â in [Intelligent Network Architecture Research Group.](http://ina.kaist.ac.kr/)

My research interest lies in any systems or applications that are networked; Internet services and applications, cloud, and systems for Artificial Intelligence. I enjoy tackling challenges that are yet explored in new or existing systems and my goal is to provide solutions for them with practical system design. I find the research more interesting when novel opportunities or ideas are discovered from other domains and can be translated into networked systems.
