Hi, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at [Inha University](https://eng.inha.ac.kr/eng/3915/subview..do), where I lead the **NAIS Lab** (Networking, AI and Systems Lab). Prior to joining Inha, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with [Prof. Srinivasan Seshan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/) and [Prof. Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/).
Before that, I received my Ph.D. from KAIST, advised by [Prof. Dongsu Han](https://ina.kaist.ac.kr/team/dongsuh).

My research interests lie in networked computer systems and applications, including multimedia applications, Internet services, cloud computing, and systems for AI. 
<!-- My current research focuses on developing efficient networking solutions for multimedia applications and AI workloads. -->

**<i class="fas fa-lightbulb" style="color: #f0b429;"></i> I am actively looking for collaborations and recruiting graduate students (MS/Ph.D.). Undergrad students are also welcome. If you are highly motivated and interested in networking, AI-based multimedia, or systems for AI, please contact me at [jaehong.kim@inha.ac.kr](mailto:jaehong.kim@inha.ac.kr)**.

<!-- I aim to improve their performance and enhance user experience through novel approaches.  -->
<!-- During my Ph.D., I worked on AI-based video delivery systems, 5G MAC scheduling, and datacenter networking. During my postdoc at CMU, I explored compression and delivery techniques for 3D video streaming to push the boundaries of immersive experiences. My current research focuses on developing efficient networking solutions for multimedia applications and AI workloads. -->

<!-- Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Computer Science Department at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://csd.cmu.edu/), co-advised by [Prof. Srinivasan Seshan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/) and [Prof. Anthony Rowe](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~agr/). Prior to CMU, I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from KAIST, supervised by [Prof. Dongsu Han](https://ina.kaist.ac.kr/team/dongsuh), with a focus on enabling high-quality 2D and 3D live streaming.

<!-- Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in [Intelligent Network Architecture Research Group](http://ina.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST, advised by [Prof. Dongsu Han](http://ina.kaist.ac.kr/~dongsuh/).

My research interest lies in any computer systems or applications that are networked; Internet services, cloud, and systems for Artificial Intelligence. I focus on improving their performance to enhance the user experience with novel ideas.
<!-- I enjoy tackling challenges that are yet explored in new systems. -->

<!-- I have worked on 1) applying neural enhancement to video streaming in a way that maximizes viewer experience and 2) designing a practical cell-scale scheduler for latency-sensitive traffic in 4G/5G networks.  --> 
<!-- and my goal is to provide solutions for them with innovative ideas. -->
<!-- I look for new opportunities and ideas in different research fields to bring benefits to networked systems and applications. -->
