Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in [Intelligent Network Architecture Research Group](http://ina.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST, advised by [Prof. Dongsu Han](http://ina.kaist.ac.kr/~dongsuh/).

My research interest lies in any computer systems or applications that are networked; Internet services, cloud, and systems for Artificial Intelligence. I focus on improving their performance to enhance the user experience with novel ideas.
<!-- I enjoy tackling challenges that are yet explored in new systems. -->

I have worked on 1) applying neural enhancement to video streaming in a way that maximizes viewer experience and 2) designing a practical cell-scale scheduler for latency-sensitive traffic in 4G/5G networks. 
<!-- and my goal is to provide solutions for them with innovative ideas. -->
<!-- I look for new opportunities and ideas in different research fields to bring benefits to networked systems and applications. -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
