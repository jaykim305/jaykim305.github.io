  abstract = {High-definition live streaming has experienced tremendous growth. However, the video quality of live video is often limited by the streamer's uplink bandwidth. Recently, neural-enhanced live streaming has shown great promise in enhancing the video quality by running neural super-resolution at the ingest server. Despite its benefit, it is too expensive to be deployed at scale. To overcome the limitation, we present NeuroScaler, a framework that delivers efficient and scalable neural enhancement for live streams. First, to accelerate end-to-end neural enhancement, we propose novel algorithms that significantly reduce the overhead of video super-resolution, encoding, and GPU context switching. Second, to maximize the overall quality gain, we devise a resource scheduler that considers the unique characteristics of the neural-enhancing workload. Our evaluation on a public cloud shows NeuroScaler reduces the overall cost by 22.3\texttimes{} and 3.0--11.1\texttimes{} compared to the latest per-frame and selective neural-enhancing systems, respectively.},

  abstract = {Live video accounts for a significant volume of today's Internet video. Despite a large number of efforts to enhance user quality of experience (QoE) both at the ingest and distribution side of live video, the fundamental limitations are that streamer's upstream bandwidth and computational capacity limit the quality of experience of thousands of viewers.To overcome this limitation, we design LiveNAS, a new live video ingest framework that enhances the origin stream's quality by leveraging computation at ingest servers. Our ingest server applies neural super-resolution on the original stream, while imposing minimal overhead on ingest clients. LiveNAS employs online learning to maximize the quality gain and dynamically adjusts the resource use to the real-time quality improvement. LiveNAS delivers high-quality live streams up to 4K resolution, outperforming WebRTC by 1.96 dB on average in Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio on real video streams and network traces, which leads to 12%-69% QoE improvement for live stream viewers.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
